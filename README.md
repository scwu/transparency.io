## Synopsis

Creating a search engine to find out exactly what companies support, how much influence corporations have in an election, and what percentage each corporations contributed to the election. >>
 
## First steps 

Implement basic searching and auto-completion with Influence Explorer's API - because the querying sucks, implement a view that reads a base CSV file and inserts all the corporations into a postgres database - then use Ajax and Django to autocomplete for you (possibly use some kind of stemming algorithm, but we'll see). 

## Data visualization
 
Implement data visualization in an interesting interactive way. 
 
## Suggestions
 
Don't like their political philosophy? Search for similar products from the product search view.
